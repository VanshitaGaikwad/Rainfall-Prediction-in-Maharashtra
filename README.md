# Rainfall-Prediction-in-Maharashtra
IBM Data Analytics using Python - Micro Internship Project

## Introduction

One of the most significant real-world issues is rainfall detection, particularly in the agriculture industry. Forecasting weather patterns is necessary to comprehend and evaluate variables such as which crop to plant, when to harvest, safety measures to take in the field, etc. The entire agricultural process is heavily reliant on the weather. Accurately predicting the weather is difficult, which is where machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) come into play. Properly adjusted hyper-parameters on well trained models can produce reliable forecasts. The study involves applying certain machine learning models to detect patterns of rainfall.

## DATASET 

The data was taken from : https://www.kaggle.com/rajanand/rainfall-in-india?select=rainfall+in+india+1901-2015.csv

# Algorithms - 
used three ML models - Random Forest, Lasso and Linear Regression models. 

## CONCLUSION

This project has been designed to predict the rainfall for one state in India, Maharashtra. Rainfall Prediction is one of the most difficult and uncertain tasks that has a significant impact on human society. Accurate and timely rainfall prediction can proactively help reduce human and financial loss. This project was started with the hopes that it will help the farmers and other people in the agricultural industry to choose their crops wisely for the harvest season so that they would not have to face any loss.
